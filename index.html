          This is a prototype application for providing interactive feedback on the effect of timing of ultrasound appointments on fetal growth estimation accuracy.  In its current state, the goal is to experiment with different visual / interactive components and wire them together.  Everything is currently based on dummy data.

          Click the number of ultrasound measurements to see handles on the timing slider appear &ndash; initially set at fabricated "optimal" times (denoted by the red tick marks).  Then drag the handles on the slider to see the distributions update.
